                        <p>I am a Software Engineering student who is currently learning how to program a website!</p>
                        
                        <p>I was born and raised in Yakima, Washington to a father who immigrated from <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colombia"><strong>Colombia</strong></a> and a mother who spent most of her childhood in South America as a missionary kid. Living here in the US, this resulted in me being raised in a mix of Hispanic and American cultures, which I love, but <em>has</em> had its challenges. I was homeschooled for my whole childhood until 11th grade, where I started college classes at our local community college. </p>
                        <p>I first started coding when I was around 10 or 11 years old, working on simple javascript in a course by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming/programming">Khan Academy</a>. I spent my last two years of high school taking college courses and graduated in 2024 with my Associate's in Computer Science from Yakima Valley College. I transferred to <strong>Neumont</strong> in fall of 2024, where I am working on a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering!</p>
                        <p>I have spent my summers the last several years volunteering at Shiloh Bible Camp near the coast in Washington. Last summer I spent whole 8 weeks there as part of their "intern" program, doing all sorts of things from running games, leading music, and preaching sermons; it was quite the experience!. It was at this camp that I met my amazing girlfriend several years ago, and we have been going strong even with being long-distance. When on breaks from Neumont, I fly back home to Washington so I can see my girlfriend and my family and enjoy the time I have with them.</p>
